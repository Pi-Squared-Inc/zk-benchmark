#   This is framework code for a common command-line API for building,
#   testing and running checkers. It's not a stand-alone script (thus
#   it's not executable and has a .bash extension); it should be
#   sourced by the checker/*/*/check scripts as follows:
#
#       #!/usr/bin/env bash
#       . "$(dirname "$0")/../../common/check-api.bash"
#
#   The script must also supply build(), test() and check() functions that
#   accept appropriate arguments; in standard cases these can simply call
#   the *_{build,test,check}() functions defined here. After defining
#   these, the script should then call `main "$@"`.
#
#   Note that the command line parameters passed by the user may include
#   relative paths which will not work from other than the invoker's
#   directory. When using these, you must remain in the original CWD;
#   you can find files with $CHECKER and $BUILD when necessary.
#   If you must change CWD, use a subshell (e.g. `( command cd … && … )`),
#   but relative paths given on the command line will no longer be correct.
#
#   This exports the following variables:
#   • $CHECKER: absolute path to the checker's dir,
#     e.g. /…/checker/mm/mm-risc0
#   • $BUILD: absolute path to the checker's build directory,
#     always /…/.build/checker/.

#   Cargo, for some stupid reason, does not read .cargo/config.toml
#   files upwards from where the manifest (Cargo.toml) lives, but from
#   the current working directory, which means that the configuration
#   may change based on where you run it. To avoid this, we always
#   cd into the given directory so we get a consistent configuration
#   regardless of the caller's CWD. This means that any paths given
#   on the command line are relative to the dir containing Cargo.toml,
#   but there's no easy way around this, since if we left you in CWD,
#   even if we find and pass all the configuration files at or above
#   the Cargo.toml dir, other files above where you happen to be would
#   also be processed.
