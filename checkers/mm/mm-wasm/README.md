## Prerequisites

Check [`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) for instructions on installing the dependencies.

## Building and running

Building and running the tool happen through the [checker](./checker) script
which, prior to going through the actual checking process, will check that
the required tools were made available by the steps described in `setup.sh`

```
$ ./checker --help
checker [options] command [argsâ€¦]
Commands:
  build   build the checker; see the checker's README for build requirements
  test    run the checker unit tests (requires a `build` first)
  run     run the checker (requires a `build` first)
Options:
  -d,--dry-run    dont run commands, just show what would be executed
  -c,--certgen    generate ZK certificate (greatly increases runtime)
  -r,--release    build/use release version of code
  -h,--help       print this help message
```

For internal reasons, currenly the mm-wasm checker won't run if not passed
the `-r` flag.
